/*
 * The center of the euchre bot is the different types of players. When running
 * the program one can choose between several different strategies that are used
 * throughout all decision making processes. These options will be for example,
 * random, AI, rule based and possibly more. These options are chosen through a
 * struct that implements this Player interface. The underlying logic will then
 * follow different models.
 *
 * A player must be provided with all the game information it does not keep
 * track of it through the game. A player is essentially an encapsulation of
 * game logic. This game logic is housed in some person and can be used in any
 * player position. Reasoning methods define the player, not the actual player
 * through a euchre game.
