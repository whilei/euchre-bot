/*
 * Creates a new SmartPlayer with the given attributes. These attributes are the
 * inputs to the models behind the SmartPlayer's logic. Confidence is on a scale
 * from the maximum possible evaluation to the minimum possible evaluation
 * according to the MCTS evaluation function. Runs is how many times to run a
 * simulation on a given determinization. Determinizations says how many
 * different determinizations to go through.
 *
 * Args:
 *  pickupConfidence: The confidence needed to tell the dealer to pickup.
 *  callConfidence: The confidence needed to call suit after everybody passes.
 *  pickupRuns: The amount of times to run a determinization for picking up.
 *  pickupDeterminizations: The amount of determinizations for picking up.
 *  callRuns: The amount of times to run a determinization for calling suit.
 *  callDeterminizations: The amount of determinizations for calling suit.
 *  playRuns: The amount of times to run a determinization for a general play.
 *  playDeterminizations: The amount of determinizations for a general play.
 *  aloneRuns: The amount of times to run a determinization for going alone.
 *  aloneDeterminizations: The amount of determinizations for going alone.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  A SmartPlayer that uses the given parameters in its decision making.
